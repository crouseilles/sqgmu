This project provides Matlab codes to simulate a randomized version of the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) model.
The random dynamics is based on the transport under location uncertainty.
The following paper describes the method:
Geophysical flows under location uncertainty, Resseguier V., MÃ©min E., Chapron B. 2016

This codes needs the MATLAB image processing toolbox.
Launch the script main.m to execute the algorithm.
Plots and temporary files are saved each day of simulation in the folder images.
