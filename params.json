  "body": "This MATLAB codes simulates deterministic or randomized version of the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) model in geophysical fluid dynamics.\r\nThe random dynamics is based on the transport under location uncertainty. The ensuing model is referred to as SQG model under moderate uncertainty (SQG_MU).",
